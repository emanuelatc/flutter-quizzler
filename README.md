# Quizzler - Emanuela Sîrcă (Tudose)

Quizzler is a quiz app that tests your general knowledge.

I created this application following the officially recommended course by Flutter found on [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart) website.

The Quizzler application can be found in the 10th section of the course.
